# Task Management Web Application

A simple and intuitive **Task Management Web Application** built with the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). This project allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The app also ensures data persistence across sessions by using local storage, and it features a fully responsive UI built with **Bootstrap**.

## Key Features:
- **Add Tasks**: Create tasks by providing a name, description, and due date.
- **Edit Tasks**: Modify task details (name, description, due date) after creation.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list with an optional confirmation.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Toggle tasks as completed with a checkbox, which applies a visual strikethrough effect.
- **Data Persistence**: Tasks persist across page reloads via **localStorage**.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, thanks to **Bootstrap**, ensuring an optimized experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used:
- **Frontend**: React, JSX, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express (Optional if adding a server-side feature)
- **Persistence**: Local Storage
- **Styling**: Bootstrap (Grid System, Forms, Buttons, Cards)
